 Structural Design of a G+7 Residential Building Using ETABS  .This repository contains the Industrial Training Project completed under  the "Summer of Core – IIT Bombay", focusing on the structural analysis  and design of a G+7 reinforced concrete residential building using ETABS.

This repository contains my Industrial Training Project completed under the Summer of Core – IIT Bombay, where I worked on the structural design and analysis of a G+7 residential building using ETABS. The project focuses on understanding the structural behavior of reinforced concrete framed buildings integrated with shear walls under various loading conditions, including dead load, live load, wind load, and seismic forces as per relevant IS codes. The residential building has a plan area of 28.04m × 48.73m and is designed for Seismic Zone IV, with M40 grade concrete and HYSD 500 steel. The repository includes the complete industrial training report, along with ETABS models, load applications, structural diagrams, and analysis results such as bending moment diagrams, shear force diagrams, and displacement plots. It also covers the design of structural components like slabs, beams, shear walls, and a dog-legged staircase. This project helped me gain practical exposure to ETABS, understand the workflow of structural modeling, analyze load combinations, and interpret results based on IS 456:2000, IS 875, IS 1893:2016, and IS 13920:2016. The training strengthened my understanding of structural engineering concepts and enhanced my skills in designing safe, efficient, and code-compliant building structures.
